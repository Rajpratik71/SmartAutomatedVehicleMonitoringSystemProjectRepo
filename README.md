# SmartAutomatedVehicleMonitoringSystemProjectRepo

This repository contain the code snippets as well as some guide and how to's of the Project Smart Automated Vehicle Monitoring System

# This Project repo consist of four other folder .

1. Idea named as "Smart Automated vehicle Monitoring System" .

# To implement the project or simply for testing purpose, the things needed are :

1. Arduino IDE (for project debugging).

2. Thingspeak service (for cloud based Integration).

3. Arduino (for full working demonstration).

4. NodeMcu based wifi Module (for full working demonstration).

5. Other sensors module for data logging and Monitoring (for full working demonstration).

# and further four folders as following :

1. "dht11_nodemcu_full_thingspeak source" consist of the source file of the second implementation of the project using NodeMcu wifi module and Thingspeak APIs.
							  In the folder , the source ".ino" file is Arduino IDE compatabile source file.And the ".bin" file is NodeMcu module's bootloader cum image file.

2. "dht11_nodemcu_full_thingspeak using nodemcu in arduino ide screenshot" consist of some screenshot of the arduino ide and the Thingspeak websites and my implementation using the APIs provided.
